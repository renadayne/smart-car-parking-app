## About Us
We are a group of students from UET-VNU with a passion for exploring technology knowledge

## About our project
The project 'Smart Car Parking System' is the project our team chose to participate in the IoT Challenge 2022 - a competition organized by FPT Software and Telecommunications Electronics Faculty of UET-VNU. And the 'Smart Car Parking App' is the product developed by me (Rena) with the aim of creating an app to track the location of parking lots and whether they are available or not.
